# Creative Coding with Swift

Created by Prof. Masood Kamandy

## Introduction

Welcome to Creative Coding with Swift! This course is a free and open-source course developed by Masood Kamandy for students at Pasadena City College and the University of California Santa Barbara.

Creative Coding is a way of learning how to program by creating visual art with computer graphics. It's an umbrella term that encompasses many different approaches to using **code as a medium for art**. You'll hear words like **generative** and **procedural** a lot. One way of defining looking at it is that we will be making art by writing instructions for a computer to follow and sometimes we'll introduce randomness to make the outcomes varied and unknown.

There is a long history and many approaches to using code to create art. The goal of this course is to help you find your own approach and perspective through hands-on practice.

You can engage in creative coding through many different languages. There are creative coding frameworks written in Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, Rust, and Swift to name just a few. In this course we'll be using the Swift-flavored version of Processing called SwiftProcessing.

### Processing Resources

SwiftProcessing is fundamentally different from Processing and p5.js. That said, the communities and resources available for those platforms can be enormously helpful and once you learn the differences between Processing/p5.js and SwiftProcessing it can be easy to translate between the frameworks.

Attribution is a challenge, so I've made every effort to give credit where credit is due, and every effort has been made to ensure that this course is as unique as possible within the context of the open-source community. If you have any concerns in this regard, please [contact me](mailto:masood@masoodkamandy.com).

This course was created using knowledge I've accrued through my experience from many, many teachers, mentors, friends, and other contacts who fed my excitement about art, design, photography, and code. Contained in all of these assignments, directly or indirectly, are their teachings, their support, or both, and for them I am grateful.

The single largest influence was having Casey Reas as a professor and advisor. Many of these assignments started out in his courses and served as the foundation of my own teaching career.

Others who I offer my gratitude to are Derek Milne, Ben Fry, Adam Ferriss, Chandler McWillians, Daniel Temkin, Jon Kaufman, Christopher O'Leary, April Kawaoka, Silvia Rigon, Melanie Willhide, Zaki Kamandy, Brad Larsen, Lauren Lee McCarthy, Zöe Wood, Jennifer Jacobs, Penelope Umbrico, James Welling, Cathy Opie, Kathy Ryan, Stephen Frailey, Golan Levin, Daniel Shiffmann, George Legrady, Tobias Hollerer, and Keiko *the* Shiba Inu.
