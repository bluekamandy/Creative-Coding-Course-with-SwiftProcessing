# Module 7: Final Proposal

## Introduction

In order to be able to give you **sufficient feedback** on  your proposal and point you to the resources you will need in order to  succeed, you will need to turn in a well-planned final proposal. This  will enable your professor to help you work through your final projects.

## Instructions

For 20% of your final project's grade, you'll need to share your **first week's progress**.

**Note:** Before completing this assignment, be sure to read the final project prompt completely, so that you can create a useful proposal.

**Progress should include:**

1. A basic **written proposal** of at least 300 words. **Include a word count** at the bottom of your proposal.
2. A **timeline** for how you will be using the final weeks of the course with significant milestones and **check-ins with your professor**.
3. Some **preliminary research**, including a **list of resources** you plan on using.
4. Documentation of a **basic prototype**. This can be in the form of sketches, storyboards, or software prototypes.
