# Module 2: Exercise

## For Loop & Repetition

![Grid of circles](images/grid.png)

## Introduction

**For loops** allow you to create complex structures and **repeat code** in powerful ways to accomplish a lot with just a few lines. If you find yourself repeating yourself when you're coding, it's always a good idea to think about whether a for loop might work better.

## Instructions

Create a **for loop that fills the canvas with a grid of circles**. You can decorate them any way you'd like. You can use the image above  for inspiration or draw from art history. You can also create more complex shapes if you'd like.

**Incorporate touch** (both X and Y position using the `touchX` and `touchY` keywords) to manipulate the circles in some way. Here are a few options:

\- Touch position increases the number of circles.
\- Touch position affects the size of the circles.
\- Touch position affects the colors of the circles.
\- Any combination of the above!

You must **use a for loop**.

You must also **incorporate randomness** in some way. Use your Playground textook chapter titled *Randomness* to guide you.

This page will explain the `random()` function and will give you code examples.

There must be **at least 100 circles** when the screen is totally filled, but feel free to make more if you need.
