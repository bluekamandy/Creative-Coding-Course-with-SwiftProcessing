# Module 2: Color, Loops, and Animation

## Introduction

In the last module you learned the  fundamentals of programming. You are now a programmer!

There's a lot more to learn, though, and we'll continue to fill out your knowledge by exploring a few new concepts that involve the beginnings of **storing data**, **animation**, **repetition**, **basic arithmetic**, **control flow** and **using touch for interaction!**

**Interactivity** and **indeterminacy** are two of the most important benefits of bringing code into your art  and design practice. In this course we will try to emphasize these qualities of code.

What does ***interactivity*** mean?

Interactivity is another way of saying participatory. The viewer of your artwork isn't just consuming, they are participating. They are deciding. They have a stake in the process.

What does ***indeterminacy*** mean?

Indeterminacy means that when we start a  process, we aren't certain how it's going to end. Many natural processes are indeterminate. For example, when I see a tree sapling, I can't fully know exactly what it will look like when it grows old. Its growth  depends on a process and many factors. You can look at your code in the  same way.
