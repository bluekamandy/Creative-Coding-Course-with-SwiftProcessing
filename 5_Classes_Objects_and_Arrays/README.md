# Module 5: Classes, Objects, and Arrays

## Introduction

Welcome to **Module 5** of Creative Coding!

Students generally find the topics in this module to be more challenging than previous ones. **Budget a bit of extra time** to go over concepts. It is recommended that, in addition to reading your assignment, that you seek out additional information through external research.

This module will cover **objects**, **classes**, and **arrays**.

**Object-oriented programming** is a way of programming that uses the **metaphor of physical objects** as a way of organizing code. An object is like a function (or sets of functions) with an added layer of data.

**Arrays** are variables that contain more than one point of data. They are multiples. The most common array that we have worked with so far is the **pixel array** that gets displayed on the screen. Pixel number 0 is in the upper left  hand side of the screen and depending on the size, the last pixel will  be the result of multiplying the width by the height.

Through discussion, practice, and reading you will tackle some of **the most important concepts in programming** this module. It will open doors for you and allow you to program in far more complex ways.
