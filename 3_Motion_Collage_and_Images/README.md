# Module 3: Motion, Collages, and Images

## Introduction

This module is all about **building on your drawing skills** and **media**. You will be working with **sound**, **fonts**, **shapes**, and **images** to create interactive and indeterminate experiences that unfold as they play.

The most important thing to think about as you are working on this unit is to think about what **compositional logic** means to you. If you are creating a system to draw to the screen, how do you decide what region to place your items in?

Some genres of images have an inherent logic. For example, the compositional logic of a landscape usually involves the foreground and background. The  compositional logic of a portrait usually involves the subject and the  setting. Can you think of types images that have an inherent compositional logic? 

There are established systems of compositional logic. In photography there is the compositional truism called [**The Rule of Thirds**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds). Leonardo DaVinci used the [**Golden Ratio**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio#Art) as a compositonal system. In Japanese art, the concept of *[**Ma**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_(negative_space))* means that negative (or empty) space is equally important in a work of art.

Can you invent your own compositonal logic?

With creative coding, we can turn these systems into code. 

For this module will also need to fully understand how to use **`map()`** and **`lerp()`** in these sections. If you still need practice with these, this is your time to shine!
