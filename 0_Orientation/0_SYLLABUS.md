# Creative Coding with Swift

by Prof. Masood Kamandy

## Introduction

Welcome to Creative Coding with Swift! This course is a free and open-source course developed by Masood Kamandy for students at Pasadena City College and the University of California Santa Barbara.

Creative Coding is way of learning how to program by creating visual art with computer graphics. It's an umbrella term that encompasses many different approaches to using **code as a medium for art**. You'll hear words like **generative** and **procedural** a lot. That basically means that we take the practice of making art, turn them into instructions, and sometimes introduce some randomness to make the outcomes unknown.

There is a long history and many approaches to using code to create art. The goal of this course is to help you find your own approach and perspective.

You can engage in creative coding through many different languages. There are creative coding frameworks written in Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, Rust, and Swift to name just a few. In this course we'll be using the Swift-flavored version of Processing called SwiftProcessing.
