# Module 4: Reading

The readings for this course will all be from the SwiftProcessing Playgrounds. These playgrounds can be found as a part of the [SwiftProcessing package](https://github.com/jjkaufman/SwiftProcessing/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Modularity

- Functions

## The Swift Programming Language

This is the first time I've assigned a reading from The [Excellent] Swift Programing Guide. This is because it's a fair bit more challenging and technical, but in the case of functions, there's no better source.

- [Functions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html)

## FORM+CODE: In Design, Art, and Architecture

by Casey Reas, Chandler McWilliams, and LUST

#### Chapter 5: Parameterize

- Composition Systems
- Variables
- Control
