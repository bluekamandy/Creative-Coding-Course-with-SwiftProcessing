# Module 4: Reading

The readings for this course will all be from the SwiftProcessing Playgrounds. These playgrounds can be found as a part of the [SwiftProcessing package](https://github.com/jjkaufman/SwiftProcessing/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Modularity

- Functions

## The Swift Programming Language

This is the first time I've assigned a reading from The [Excellent] Swift Programing Guide. This is because it's a fair bit more challenging and technical, but in the case of functions, there's no better source.
