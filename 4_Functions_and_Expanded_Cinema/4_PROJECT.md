## Expanded Cinema Part 1

![Chris_Marker](images/Chris_Marker.jpg)

A still from La Jetée (1962) by Chris Marker. This science fiction film is composed entirely of film stills and its time-travel narrative is non-linear. The film is [viewable here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU99W-ZrIHQ).

## Introduction

> "Expanded cinema is used to describe a film, video, multi-media performance or an immersive environment that pushes the boundaries of cinema and rejects the traditional one-way relationship between the audience and the screen."
>
> —From [The Tate Museum's *Art Terms*](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/e/expanded-cinema))

In this assignment you will create a cinematic experience that moves  beyond the traditional definition of cinema and creates an experience  that changes every time its run.

## Film

The French filmmaker [Chris Marker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HrujmaJ5zU) is one of the pioneers of experimental cinema. **La Jetée** is a science fiction film created in 1962 using **only still images and a voice over**. The film later became the inspiration for Terry Gilliam's film ***12 Monkeys***.

Watch the film as inspiration for your project.

## Instructions

You will work on this project over **two modules**. You'll need the time.

You will be creating a **looping**, cinematic experience that is **different each time through the cycle**. Use ideas found in modern **video games**, Chris Marker's ***La Jetée***, **animated GIFs**, and ***Choose Your Own Adventure*** novels as a start to write a program that sequences graphics,  photographs, or video into a continuous cinematic experience of your own creation.

A good example of this kind of film making that goes beyond a linear narrative is Netflix's ***[Bandersnatch](https://www.netflix.com/title/80988062)*** or HBO's ***[Mosaic](https://www.hbo.com/mosaic)***.

Another inspiration can come from the ***Choose Your Own Adventure*** series of books, which offered readers multiple possible endings.

Submit both inspiration/research and process images (screen shots and scans of sketches) and your finished file. You can simply **zip** it all in a single folder.

**No pre-made fonts for this assignment.** Your typography should be composed of all of the line/shape functions we have learned so far or any other method for creating primitive shapes you have researched.

## Recommended Approach

There are many different approaches to completling this assignment, but one that has been very successful among students has been using a `switch`. Information about how to use the `switch` structure in Swift are in your Playground textbook in the *Conditional Logic* Playground. You may also find *The Swift Programming Language*'s section on [Conditional Statements](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ControlFlow.html#ID127) helpful.

## Other Notable Inspiring Works

### Frank & Caroline Mouris's Frank Film (1973)

![Frank and Caroline Mouris' Frank Film](images/Mouris_Frank_Film.jpg)

> Frank Film is a 1973 animated short film. Co-creator Frank Mouris reads a list of words starting with the letter "f". This  sound track is interwoven with the sound of his reading his  autobiography. The visual is an animated collage of photos collected from magazines. Frank made the film with Caroline Mouris. The sound  track was created by Tony Schwartz. 
>
> The movie won an Academy Award for Best Short Subject, Animated Films and has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

> Jafa’s work is a seven-minute video made up of clips collaged from original and found footage. Distressing scenes of historic and contemporary violence inflicted on Black Americans by individuals and institutions are woven with scenes of religious ecstasy, athletic prowess, poetic and musical performance—what Jafa has called ‘a Black display of Black excellence.’
