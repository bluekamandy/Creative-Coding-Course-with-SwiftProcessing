# Module 4: Functions and Expanded Cinema

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 4! This module is all about fleshing out your **animation** skills and learning about **functions**.

Functions are pieces of code that have been **encapsulated**. Writing your own functions means you can always call on a function knowing that its behavior is consistent with your understanding. You know it simply works, so you don't have to mess with the code inside. We've been working with functions for a while now. Remember that `rect()` function? We know it draws a rectangle so we don't need to know how. We just expect it to work and that's the beauty.

One benefit of this is that **you can take your code from one project to another, and it will work!** Functions are the first step toward making your code  re-usable and modular. When you create a function once, you never need  to do it again and it can be used in multiple projects.

The ultimate goal might be to have a utility-chest of functions that you've written that will help you  accomplish tasks throughout your projects.
