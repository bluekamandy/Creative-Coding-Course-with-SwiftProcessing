# Module 6: Using Objects to Create a Game

## Introduction

Welcome to **Module 6** of Creative Coding!

Module 6 is all about **games** and **synthesis**! You're going to be creating a game in a **group** and applying all of the knowledge to build your own rudimentary "game engine."

The game we'll be focusing on is **Pong**, but you can create any variant of this game you'd like and make it your own. Creativity is the main requirement!

This project will involve a higher level of problem solving. You will have to break down all of the problems you  need to solve in the game of pong and solve each one individually. This  is where working on a team is helpful. If you distribute the tasks, you can bring it all together in the end to do far more than you would be  able to alone.
